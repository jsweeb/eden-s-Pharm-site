          A Return to the Garden. A Leap Forward in Wellness.
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Eden’s Pharm began the way many good stories do—with a problem and a
          question.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">From Kitchen Counter to Clinical Craft: Our Origin Story</h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          It started when I began following a ketovore diet. I quickly
          realised I needed a clean electrolyte supplement—but everything on the
          market was either packed with sugar, filled with cheap fillers, or
          had ingredients that interfered with each other. The few that almost
          got it right were prohibitively expensive.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          So I decided to make my own. I went down a rabbit hole of research,
          testing and daily use until I landed on the Hydrosal: Raw
          formula—a simple, clean electrolyte blend that I still drink every
          day. It became the cornerstone of an entire hydration line.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          But I couldn’t do it alone. I reached out to my friend—and now
          business partner—Brandon, and together we began formulating
          flavoured versions. Our first attempt? Let’s just say it was a noble
          failure. It tasted okay, but it didn’t meet our standards.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          We had started off using a commercial sweetener blend that included
          stevia—which led to another rabbit hole. I learned that while stevia
          is generally safe for men, it’s a hormone disruptor for women and has
          even been used traditionally as a contraceptive in the Amazon. That
          wasn’t acceptable.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          So I created our own: <strong>Benedulce™</strong>, a clean, functional
          sweetener with a 1:1 sugar replacement ratio—powered by alulose,
          monk fruit, erythritol, xylitol and collagen.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Once that door opened, I couldn’t stop. I began reading every
          label—from supplements to seasonings—and was shocked at how many
          “health” products were hiding unnecessary or harmful ingredients. That
          realisation gave birth to our <strong>Elation™</strong> line of
          functional adaptogenic supplements and clean culinary blends.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Then one day, my sister asked if I could make her a face balm from
          tallow. Challenge accepted. Another rabbit hole. Another revelation.
          The result was our hero skincare product: Renew Balm—and eventually
          the launch of our <strong>Sanctus Unā</strong> line, a reverent return
          to ancestral skincare using grass‑fed tallow and botanicals.
        </p>
        <p className="italic leading-relaxed">
          I never set out to build a wellness company. But now that we have,
          we’re going to do it the right way.

          That means putting people over profit, purpose over trends and
          truth over convenience. We embrace clean design, regenerative
          sourcing and honest communication—because the best medicine is trust.
